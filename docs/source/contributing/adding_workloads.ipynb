    "# Adding New Workloads\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding new workloads into benchmark-wrapper is a fairly straightforward process, but requires a bit of work. This page tracks all the changes that a user needs to make when adding in a new benchmark.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "    \n",
    "benchmark-wrapper is currently undergoing a re-write, meaning a lot of change is happening pretty quickly. The information on this page is relevant to the new modifications which change the way in which benchmarks should be added. It may not be consistent to the way in which existing benchmarks are developed.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n",
    "    \n",
    "This page is written within a Jupyter Notebook, however running benchmark-wrapper from within a Jupyter Notebook is not tested nor supported.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step Zero: Prep\n",
    "\n",
    "A Benchmark within benchmark-wrapper is essentially just a Python module which handles setting up, running, parsing and tearing down a benchmark. To create our benchmark, we need to understand the following items:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the human-readable, camel-case-able string name for our benchmark?\n",
    "1. What arguments does the benchmark wrapper need from the user?\n",
    "1. Are there any setup tasks that our benchmark wrapper needs to perform?\n",
    "1. How do we run our benchmark?\n",
    "1. Are there any cleanup tasks that our benchmark wrapper needs to perform?\n",
    "1. What data should the benchmark export?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll create a new benchmark wrapper that does a ping test against a list of given hostnames and IPs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We'll call it ``pingtest``\n",
    "1. We need to know which hosts the user wants to ping and how many pings the user wants to perform.\n",
    "1. We need to verify that the arguments that the user gave us are valid. We'll also create a temp file to show that the benchmark is running.\n",
    "1. We can run our ping tests using the ``ping`` shell command.\n",
    "1. We need to clean up our 'I-am-running' temp file.\n",
    "1. For each pinged host, we want to output a single result detailing the result of the ping session (RTT information, packet loss %, IP resolution, errors).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step One: Initialize\n",
    "\n",
    " To begin, let's create the required files for our benchmark by creating a new Python package under ``snafu/benchmarks``:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "snafu/benchmarks/pingtest/\n",
    "├── __init__.py\n",
    "└── pingtest.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside ``pingtest.py``, we'll create our initial ``Benchmark`` subclass. Inside this subclass, there are a few\n",
    "class variables which we need to set:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ``tool_name``: This is the camel-case name for our benchmark.\n",
    "1. ``args``: These are the arguments which our Benchmark will pull from the user through the CLI, OS environment, and/or from a configuration file (CLI is preferred over the OS environment, which is preferred over the configuration file). In the background, snafu uses [configargparse](https://pypi.org/project/ConfigArgParse/) to do the dirty-work, which is a helpful wrapper around Python's own [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html). The ``args`` class variable should be set to a tuple of ``snafu.config.ConfigArgument``s, which take in arguments just like ``configargparse.ArgumentParser.add_argument``. If you have used argparse in the past, this should look super familiar.\n",
    "1. ``metadata``: This is an iterable of strings which represent the metadata that will be exported with the Benchmark's results. Each string corresponds to the attribute name that the argument is stored under by ``configargparse``. For instance, creating a new argument under the ``args`` class variable with ``\"--my-metadata\", dest=\"mmd\"`` would result in the attribute name being ``mmd``. Adding ``mmd`` under ``metadata`` will in turn cause the value for the ``--my-metadata`` argument to be exported as metadata. Benchmarks will by default specify ``cluster_name``, ``user`` and ``uuid`` arguments as metadata, but if you want to use your own set of metadata keys it can be set here.\n"

    "## Part Four: Collect Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The collect method is an iterable that returns a special dataclass that is shipped with benchmark-wrapper, called a ``BenchmarkResult``. BenchmarkResult holds important information about a benchmark's resulting data, such as the configuration, metadata, labels and numerical data. It also understands how to prepare itself for export. All Benchmarks are expected to return their results using this dataclass in order to support a common interface for data exporters, reduce code reuse, and reduce extra overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "The base Benchmark class includes a helpful method called ``create_new_result``, which we will use in the example below.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our ping test benchmark, our collect method needs to run the ping command, parse its output, and yield a new BenchmarkResult. To help prevent the collect method itself from becoming super large and out of control, we'll create some new methods in our wrapper class that the collect method will call to help do its thing. Benchmarks can have any number of additional methods, just as long as they have setup, collect and cleanup.\n",
    "\n",
    "One last note here before the code: benchmark-wrapper ships with another helpful module called ``process``, which contains functions and classes to facilitate running subprocesses. In particular, we'll be using the ``get_process_sample`` function."
